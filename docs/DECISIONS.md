# Decision Log — Woodshed

Append-only, ADR-style. Newest at the bottom. Each entry: **date · decision · rationale ·
alternatives rejected**. Seeded from choices made building the Phase-0 vertical slice (2026-07-08).

Add a new ADR (don't rewrite old ones) whenever a decision changes design, architecture, stack, data
model, or a hard-to-reverse behaviour.

---

### ADR-001 — Native SwiftUI multiplatform app, fully on-device
**2026-07-08.** One SwiftUI codebase targeting macOS + iPadOS (visionOS builds along for free). No
server, NAS, cloud, account, or runtime network.
**Rationale:** personal single-user tool; native MIDI on iPad requires CoreMIDI (no Web MIDI on
iOS/Safari); privacy and zero-dependency operation.
**Rejected:** browser + NAS/Docker design (v0.1 of the PRD); web app (can't do native iPad MIDI).

### ADR-002 — Import a MusicXML + MIDI pair; MIDI = timing truth, MusicXML = identity
**2026-07-08.** Each piece is two MuseScore exports. Timing/onset in seconds comes from the MIDI; note
spelling, hand, voice, notation, ornaments come from the MusicXML.
**Rationale:** MIDI is "unfolded" (repeats/tuplets/swing/tempo-map resolved), sidestepping a whole
class of playback-timing bugs; MusicXML is the stable, documented interchange for *how it's written*.
**Rejected:** MusicXML-only (would require computing playback timing → swing/rubato bugs, proven on
the test files); MIDI-only (no spelling/hand/voice); parsing `.mscz` (undocumented, version-volatile).

### ADR-003 — Notation-centric model; absorb ornament realisations
**2026-07-08.** One `NoteEvent` per *written* note. Trill/turn/mordent realisations (many MIDI notes)
are absorbed into their parent event, not emitted as first-class notes.
**Rationale:** matches how a player reads the score; the future matcher must match the written note
leniently, never demand the realised flurry. Discovered via the Chopin (471 written vs 524 MIDI RH).
**Rejected:** one event per MIDI note-on (would make ornaments look like errors and pollute matching).

### ADR-004 — OSMD in a WKWebView for notation; Swift owns model + clock
**2026-07-08.** Render MusicXML via OpenSheetMusicDisplay inside `WKWebView`; the web layer is display
only. Swift drives cursor/colours/marks via `evaluateJavaScript`.
**Rationale:** OSMD is a mature MusicXML→SVG renderer; re-implementing engraving in Swift is out of
scope. Keeping logic/clock in Swift keeps the web layer dumb and swappable.
**Rejected:** native SVG engraving (huge scope); Verovio-native (possible later swap if the web view
feels janky, noted in PRD).

### ADR-005 — Vendor OSMD, inline it, run fully offline; no Swift package deps
**2026-07-08.** Bundle `opensheetmusicdisplay.min.js` (2.0.0) and **inline** it into `index.html`
(spliced in place of `<script src>`); zero third-party Swift packages.
**Rationale:** offline requirement (OSMD bundles VexFlow + fonts + JSZip); inlining avoids `file://`
sub-resource loading issues in WKWebView; keeps the Swift dependency surface at zero.
**Rejected:** loading OSMD from a CDN (breaks offline); `loadFileURL` with sibling resources (fragile
read-access rules — caused an early blank render).

### ADR-006 — Playback via AVAudioSequencer through per-hand samplers
**2026-07-08.** `AVAudioSequencer` plays the actual `.mid`, routing each track to a per-hand
`AVAudioUnitSampler`. Tempo via `sequencer.rate` (pitch preserved). Cursor + metronome read the
sequencer's **musical-time** position, so they follow the tempo slider automatically.
**Rationale:** the sequencer schedules on the render clock and honours the tempo map (rubato) for
free; two samplers give independent per-hand mute/solo.
**Rejected:** hand-scheduling notes on a timer (looser timing, reimplements the tempo map); a single
sampler (can't isolate hands).

### ADR-007 — Cursor/alignment by musical beat, from MIDI ticks
**2026-07-08.** Align XML↔MIDI and drive the cursor in quarter-note **beats** (`tick/ticksPerQuarter`
and MusicXML `notatedBeat`), not `seconds × BPM`.
**Rationale:** tempo-independent; survives the Chopin's 14 tempo changes and swing. OSMD's own
timestamps are notated beats, so cursor navigation matches exactly.
**Rejected:** constant-BPM second→beat conversion (drifts badly under tempo changes — observed).

### ADR-008 — Advance measures by actual filled length, not nominal meter
**2026-07-08.** The MusicXML parser advances by each measure's content length.
**Rationale:** MuseScore leaves pickup/anacrusis measures **unmarked** (`implicit` absent) and the
Chopin changes meter mid-piece; a nominal length drifts.
**Rejected:** trusting `implicit` / nominal `num×4/den` (breaks on the real files).

### ADR-009 — Disable the App Sandbox (for the spike)
**2026-07-08.** `ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX = NO`.
**Rationale:** the sandboxed WKWebView content process failed to run → blank notation. Disabling fixed
it instantly and is fine for a personal, directly-run app.
**Rejected:** keeping the sandbox with entitlements (couldn't quickly find the right set; deferred).
**Consequence:** must be revisited (with correct entitlements) for any sandboxed distribution.

### ADR-010 — macOS system GM sound bank instead of a bundled SoundFont
**2026-07-08.** Load `/System/Library/…/gs_instruments.dls` at runtime for the sampled piano.
**Rationale:** zero app-size cost for the macOS spike.
**Rejected:** bundling an `.sf2` (needed eventually for iPad, which has no system `.dls` — deferred).

### ADR-011 — Speaker mute at the samplers, not an intermediate mixer
**2026-07-08.** PC-speaker output is silenced by setting each sampler's `volume` **and** `overallGain`;
an intermediate `AVAudioMixerNode.outputVolume` does **not** mute.
**Rationale:** verified by offline render — a submix's `outputVolume = 0` still leaked; sampler
`volume = 0` renders silent (`0.00000`).
**Rejected:** the `pianoMix.outputVolume` approach (removed — didn't mute).

### ADR-012 — Follow-scroll via CSS transform, not `window.scrollTo`
**2026-07-08.** Shift the notation up with a CSS `translateY` transform on the container.
**Rationale:** `window.scrollTo` is a no-op in the SwiftUI-clipped WKWebView (not internally
scrollable), so the cursor fell out of view; a transform works regardless.
**Rejected:** `window.scrollIntoView` / `scrollTo` (didn't scroll in the embedded web view).

### ADR-013 — `XMLParser` (SAX), not `XMLDocument`, for MusicXML
**2026-07-08.** **Rationale:** `XMLDocument` is macOS-only; SAX works on iPad too.

### ADR-014 — Matching: Wait mode (step/subset) + Grade mode (windowed greedy)
**2026-07-08.** Wait mode advances when the required note-set for a beat is played (extras ignored).
Grade mode records played notes vs the playback clock and post-hoc matches each expected note to the
nearest same-pitch played note within **±300 ms of musical time**.
**Rationale:** PRD Tier A/B; generous, tunable tolerance that auto-widens in real time at slow tempo.
**Rejected (for now):** academic probabilistic score-following (out of scope); real-time online
alignment for Grade mode (post-hoc is simpler for a first cut). Tolerance is a fixed constant —
tempo-aware tolerance and early/late labelling are open.

### ADR-015 — Persistence deferred; GRDB/SQLite is the intended store
**2026-07-08.** No persistence in the spike; the PRD specifies GRDB/SQLite when built.
**Rationale:** nothing to persist yet (bundled fixtures, no library/history).
**Open:** re-evaluate **GRDB vs SwiftData** before building — SwiftData is more idiomatic for a new
multiplatform app; GRDB was chosen in the PRD for transparent SQL. Not yet decided.

### ADR-016 — Section looping: manual reposition + CC123, not AVMusicTrack loopRange
**2026-07-08.** Section practice loops by watching the playback clock in the cursor tick and calling
`AVAudioSequencer.currentPositionInSeconds = sectionStart` on the boundary, plus an All-Notes-Off
(CC 123) to both samplers to avoid hung notes, and a metronome re-sync (clicks skip past the start
position so we don't fire a burst of past clicks).
**Rationale:** full control over loop bounds, cursor, metronome, and Wait/Grade scoping; the click-skip
is a real fix needed for any mid-piece start, not just loops.
**Rejected:** `AVMusicTrack.isLoopingEnabled` / `loopRange` (less control over sub-range + the cursor
and metronome would still need manual re-sync). Grade mode intentionally does **not** loop (plays the
section once, then grades) to avoid accumulating played notes across passes.

### ADR-017 — Per-pass mistake marks via a DOM overlay, not OSMD re-render
**2026-07-08.** For per-pass grading during a section loop, missed notes are ringed with
absolutely-positioned DOM elements over the notation (`markMissed`), computed from OSMD note
`PositionAndShape.AbsolutePosition × 10 × zoom`. Wait-mode's one-shot review still re-colours
noteheads (`markMistakes`).
**Rationale:** a full OSMD `render()` per loop (every few seconds) causes a visible hitch, especially
on dense scores; an overlay updates in <1 ms and stays aligned through the follow-scroll transform.
**Rejected:** re-colouring noteheads each pass (too slow); one grade only at stop (defeats "see
progress each pass").

### ADR-018 — File-based song library (per-song folders + metadata.json), not a database yet
**2026-07-09.** The library is stored as self-contained folders under
`Application Support/Woodshed/Scores/<uuid>/` (score.musicxml + score.mid + metadata.json). No
database. Supersedes ADR-015's "GRDB is the intended store" for the current stage.
**Rationale:** songs are inherently file-centric (an XML+MIDI pair); a per-song folder is portable and
self-contained (copy/delete = done), resilient (no central index to corrupt/drift), and the library
is just a directory scan. Practice data/favourites extend `metadata.json`. Defers — doesn't preclude —
a DB: introduce GRDB only when cross-song querying (library heatmaps, spaced repetition) demands it.
**Rejected:** a master index file (central drift/corruption, less portable); GRDB/SQLite now (upfront
work + dependency not yet justified at personal-library scale). **Note:** ADR-015 remains open only
for the *future* analytics store.

### ADR-019 — Extract a `PracticeSession` view-model from the practice-view monolith
**2026-07-09.** The ~630-line practice view held all state + all playback/matching logic. Split it:
`PracticeSession` (`ObservableObject`, imports only Foundation/Combine) owns the three services, the
`FusedScore`, and every practice-mode state/logic method; `PracticeView` is a thin SwiftUI layer that
creates the session as a `@StateObject` and binds controls to it. The session **owns** its services
and re-broadcasts their `objectWillChange` so the view observes only the session. Control side-effects
that were `.onChange` modifiers became `@Published … { didSet }` on the session.
**Rationale:** done deliberately *before* the Mac/iPad redesign so the redesign only touches
presentation, and to give the matching/playback logic a UI-decoupled home (PRD §9). Lightweight MVVM,
not TCA/DI — proportionate to a single-user app.
**Rejected:** keeping services as `@StateObject` in the view and injecting them into the session
(awkward post-init wiring, implicitly-unwrapped refs); a full DI container (overkill). **Open:** lift
the *pure* matcher (no engine refs) into a standalone unit-tested `struct`; adopt `@MainActor`/Swift 6
concurrency later.

### ADR-020 — Practice-screen redesign: split view, notation-hero, adaptive control bar
**2026-07-09.** Reworked the app shell and practice screen for Mac **and** iPad from one layout:
`NavigationStack` → **`NavigationSplitView`** (library sidebar + practice detail); the practice screen
went from a scrolling stack of dense control strips to **notation at `maxHeight: .infinity`** (the
hero) + a thin header (a single `Practice · Wait · Grade` **segmented** mode control replacing the two
scattered mode toggles, plus transport) + a **`FlowLayout`** control bar that wraps instead of
overflowing + an always-visible keyboard (shorter on iPad). The Phase-0 diagnostic dump moved behind
the More menu → "Show diagnostics…" (a sheet).
**Rationale:** the fixed 360 pt notation + four dense single-row strips didn't fit or tap well on
iPad; a wrapping `FlowLayout` reflows the same controls across widths with no size-class branching
(honours the "every action reachable without swipe or hover" rule). Structural pass only — hand
colours (blue/red) unchanged and a full visual design system (tokens, colour-blind-safe scheme, Dark
Mode) is still owed.
**Rejected:** top-toolbar-plus-bottom-bar split (splits controls into two places); hiding the keyboard
by default on iPad (loses always-on live MIDI feedback); a size-class-switched layout (two code paths
vs one wrapping layout). **Verified:** builds for both the macOS and iOS SDKs; runtime tested on Mac
(boots, no crash) — not yet on iPad hardware.

## Open Questions
- Revisit ADR-009 (sandbox) and ADR-010 (sound source) before any iPad build or distribution.
- ADR-018 defers the DB; revisit when session history / cross-song analytics are built.
- Section loop has no silent reset gap and repositioning may briefly clip a sounding note; evaluate if
  it needs smoothing (ADR-016).
